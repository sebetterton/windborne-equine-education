This project is a website dedicated to sharing a little information about Windborne Equine Education, a nonprofit, and the animal who are part of the program.  It was designed with a mobile-first approach and includes media queries for both tablet and laptop/desktop screen sizes.  

In CSS, I used Flexbox to design the layout of the site and I also included 2 animations.  The h3 elements slide in upon opening or refreshing the page.  The horse--item-photo's change opacity when the mouse hovers.  

One JavaScript feature used is a function to calculate the time of day and adjust the greeting under the header accordingly.  If the website is opened in the morning, the message displays "Good morning!", for afternoon, "Good afternoon!" and for evening, "Good evening!" any other time of day the message says "Welcome."  This was completed using variables and "if"/"else if" commands.

JavaScript was also used to create a form/quiz, to verify and calculate the number of questions answered correctly, and to display the number of correct answers under the quiz after user hits the "I'm Finished!" button.  Not only does the JavaScript accurately assess how many questions were answered correctly and display the number, It also displays different GIFs and messages for 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 correct answers.  

JavaScript and CSS were used in conjuction to show/hide the messages and gifs displayed on completion of the quiz.  Before the submit button is selected, no messages or gifs are displayed.  After submission, gifs and messages pop up.  

Thanks for checking out my project!
